        <p class="navtext">
            As detailed in The Marvel Saga: Official History of The Marvel Universe #16, Susan Storm, and her younger brother, Jonathan grew up in the town of Glenville, Long Island, children of a physician named Franklin Storm and a woman named Mary. The parents left their kids alone one night to travel to a dinner honoring Dr. Storm. On the way, a tire blew out but only Mary was injured. Franklin escaped injury and insisted on operating on his wife. He was unable to save her and she died. After his wife's death, Dr. Franklin Storm became a gambler and a drunk, losing his medical practice, which led him to the accidental killing of a loan shark. Franklin did not defend himself in court, because he still felt guilty over Mary's death. With their father in prison, Susan had to become a mother figure for her younger brother.

            While living with her aunt, Susan, at the young age of 17, met her future husband, Reed Richards, a house guest who was attending college. When she graduated from high school as the award-winning captain of her Girls' Varsity Swim Team, she moved to California to attend college, where she pursued an acting career and encountered Richards again. They began to become romantically involved with each other.

            Reed Richards, working in the field of aerospace engineering, was designing a spacecraft for interstellar travel. Everything was going well until the government stopped the funding of his project. Richards, wanting to see his project through, decided to make an unscheduled test flight. Originally, it was only going to be Reed and his best friend, Ben Grimm, involved, but Susan was instrumental in persuading Reed in letting her brother and herself join them on the dangerous space mission. In space, the quartet was exposed to massive amounts of cosmic radiation. As a result, they had to abort the mission and return to Earth. After the crash landing, they realized that they gained superhuman powers; hers was the ability to become invisible at will. Realizing the potential use of their abilities, the four of them became the Fantastic Four, for the benefit of mankind. Susan adopted the code name Invisible Girl.

            About Marc
        </h2>
        <br>
        <p class="navtext">
            My name is Marc Frances and I am a 3rd year GIMM student. I was born and raised in Las Vegas Nevada and no I don't live in any of the hotels. For as long as I can remember I've loved PC games. I remember trying so desperatly to launch games on my familys old computer just so I could enjoy Half-Life. The PC ran at 2 seconds per frame and it was the greatest slideshow of my life. This simple interest stemmed out into many different areas such as computer hardware. This led to a big youtube rabbit hole and it eventually helped me get into PC building. I've helped friends and I've built for myself. In GIMM, from what I experienced so far, I would say that VR development is my favorite part. Making a VR game was probably one of the most self fulfilling things I have ever done. It's enough to make me not feel useless.
